# salinity-correction-toolbox
Set of matlab scripts to identify correction coefficients for salinity data taken from CTD rossette and glider

The plot_socib_rv_adcp is a set of python scripts and functions developed at SOCIB to plot the data collected by a SBE911+ CTD mounted onboard the SOCIB Research Vessel. They are able to plot the main variables stored into the cnv files and plot them interpolate the profiles over the longitude dimension.

## Prerequisites:
The following libraries need to be added into salinity-correction-toolbox/ext/ directory:

- SOCIB Glider Toolbox v1.0.0 - https://github.com/socib/glider_toolbox
- GSW - https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab
- m_map - https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html
- mexcdf - https://github.com/dcherian/tools/tree/master/netcdf/mexcdf/snctools
- seawater - http://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/ext_docs/seawater.htm

   
## The following features are already implemented in the toolbox:
ctd-correction-pack
glider-correction-pack
        

## The following features are planned or in development:


## Legacy
This toolbox is based on the previous code developed at SOCIB by Dr Krissy Reeve and Dr John T. Allen.
